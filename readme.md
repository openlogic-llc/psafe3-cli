# Psafe3 CLI

This is a combination of code from [WinAuth](https://github.com/winauth/winauth) and [Password Safe Reader for Windows Mobile](https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/34083/Password-Safe-Reader-for-Windows-Mobile). This is inspired by how [Strongbox](https://strongboxsafe.com/) has integrated Psafe3 files and TOTP codes. I did not remove any of the license information from the files that I used.
